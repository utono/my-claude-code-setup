# Coding Agent Tips & Best Practices

Welcome to the companion repository for the **AI Coding Fundamentals Series** on YouTube! This repo contains examples, configurations, and best practices for using Claude Code (and other AI coding agents).

YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@SeanMatthewAI

## Tutorial Series

This repository corresponds to the coding agent fundamentals series on YouTube. Each video focuses on specific techniques to improve your development workflow.

### Episode 1: Foundation Essentials
- **CLAUDE.md Optimization**: How to create effective project memory
- **Permission Management**: Give Claude Code the ability to work faster without input

## Quick Start Tips

### 1. Optimize Your CLAUDE.md Files

The `CLAUDE.md` file is your project's memory system and one of the most critical factors for consistent, high-quality output from Claude Code.

#### Key Principles:

**Keep it Short**
- Don't overload with details - contents are appended to your prompt
- Focus on essential information only
- Preserve your finite context window

**Keep it Organized**
- Structure your content logically
- Use clear headings and sections
- Make it scannable for both you and Claude

**Use Multiple CLAUDE.md Files**
- Create a master file at the project root
- Add specific CLAUDE.md files in subdirectories
- Tailor rules and context to each area of your project

#### Example Structure for Multiple Claude.md Files:

```
~/projects/
├── CLAUDE.md                # (Global project context)
├── backend/
│   └── CLAUDE.md            # (Backend-specific rules)
├── frontend/
│   └── CLAUDE.md            # (Frontend-specific context)
├── docs/
│   └── CLAUDE.md            # (Documentation guidelines)
└── shared/
    └── CLAUDE.md            # (Shared utilities context)
```

### 2. Manage Permissions Effectively

Claude Code allows you to control what commands and actions it can take automatically. Even with `Shift + Tab` (Autoaccept) enabled, you'll still get prompted for many basic operations without proper permission setup.

#### Recommended Permission Configuration

These are the permissions typically used. Configure in your `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Read(**)",
      "Edit(**)",
      "MultiEdit(**)",
      "Write(**)",
      "Grep(**)",
      "Bash(npm install:*)",
      "Bash(npx tailwindcss init:*)",
      "Glob(**)",
      "LS(**)",
      "WebSearch(**)",
      "Bash(git add:*)",
      "Bash(git mv:*)",
      "Bash(git stash:*)",
      "Bash(git diff:*)",
      "Bash(git commit:*)",
      "Bash(ls:*)",
      "Bash(tree:*)",
      "Bash(pwd:*)",
      "Bash(which:*)",
      "mcp__ide__getDiagnostics",
      "mcp__playwright__browser_navigate",
      "mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages",
      "mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate",
      "mcp__playwright__browser_close",
      "mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot",
      "mcp__playwright__browser_click"
    ],
    "deny": [],
    "ask": []
  }
}
```

#### Permission Best Practices:

✅ **DO Allow:**
- Basic file operations (Read, Edit, Write, List)
- Safe package management commands
- Git operations
- Development tool commands

❌ **DON'T Allow:**
- All bash commands globally
- `rm` (remove) commands
- System-level operations

#### YOLO Mode (Advanced)

For experienced users who want maximum automation:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

⚠️ **Warning**: If using YOLO mode, it is recommended that you containerize your Claude Code environment with Docker for safety.

### 3. Plan Correctly

The PRD/Plan/Tasks Framework helps you turn your idea into an app more effectively by giving the AI coding agent a project plan and system to execute the plan.

#### The Process:

**Step 1: Create a PRD**
Start by creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD) with your preferred AI chat interface (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, etc.). Brainstorm thoroughly about what you want to build, and draft a 1-2 paragraph prompt describing what you want. Ask the AI interface to generate a detailed PRD.

**Step 2: Generate Core Files**
From your PRD, ask AI to generate three essential files:

- **CLAUDE.md**: Distilled important details from the PRD
- **PLANNING.md**: Vision, architecture, technology stack, and required tools
- **TASKS.md**: Bullet-point tasks divided into milestones

Use these prompts:

- **Prompt to create CLAUDE.md**: "Using the PRD and the attached example CLAUDE.md file, generate a CLAUDE.md file for this project."
- **Prompt to create PLANNING.md**: "Create a PLANNING.md file that includes vision, architecture, technology stack, and required tools list for this app."
- **Prompt to create TASKS.md**: "Create a TASKS.md file with bullet points tasks divided into milestones for building this app."

**Step 3: Configure CLAUDE.md**
Add this language to your CLAUDE.md to ensure proper file usage:

```
- **Always read** PLANNING.md at the start of a new conversation to understand the app's architecture, goals, tech stack, and constraints.
- **Check** TASKS.md before starting work. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Mark completed tasks in** TASKS.md immediately after fully completing them.
- **Add any new tasks** to TASKS.md.
```

**Step 4: Initiate Development**
Start with this prompt:

```
Please read PLANNING.md, CLAUDE.md, and TASKS.md to understand the project. Then complete the first task on TASKS.md
```

Then iterate through each task, clearing context often.

#### Best Practices:

**For Large Projects:**

- Create nested CLAUDE.md, PLANNING.md, and TASKS.md files in subdirectories (backend/, frontend/, etc.)

```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md        # (Global personal default settings)
└── projects/
    ├── CLAUDE.md          # (Project-wide instructions)
    ├── backend/
    │   ├── CLAUDE.md      # (Backend-specific context)
    │   ├── PLANNING.md    # (Backend planning tasks)
    │   └── TASKS.md       # (Backend actionable tasks)
    ├── frontend/
    │   ├── CLAUDE.md      # (Frontend-specific context)
    │   ├── PLANNING.md    # (Frontend planning tasks)
    │   └── TASKS.md       # (Frontend actionable tasks)
    ├── docs/
    │   ├── CLAUDE.md      # (Docs/internals guidelines)
    │   ├── PLANNING.md    # (Docs planning tasks)
    │   └── TASKS.md       # (Docs actionable tasks)
    └── shared/
        ├── CLAUDE.md      # (Shared utils/templates context)
        ├── PLANNING.md    # (Shared planning tasks)
        └── TASKS.md       # (Shared actionable tasks)
```

- Consider migrating tasks to Linear using the Linear MCP for better task management:
  - Install Linear MCP in Claude Code with this command: `claude mcp add --transport sse linear-server https://mcp.linear.app/sse`
  - Prompt to use: "Use the Linear MCP server to migrate all tasks (completed, in progress, and future tasks) from TASKS.md and any useful context from PLANNING.md and CLAUDE.md"

**For Existing Codebases:**
Use a high-context coding agent and model (e.g., Gemini CLI) to analyze your codebase:

```
Analyze this codebase to understand project structure, architecture, technology stack, and required tools. Please see [existing documentation] and generate a detailed PRD for this project. Also create a project status .md that details all work completed to-date and any new or future milestones/sprints left to complete.
```

**Important:** Keep these files distinct - they serve related but different purposes. Avoid overlap between CLAUDE, PLANNING, and TASKS files.
